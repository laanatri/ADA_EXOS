  <p>What causes errors in HTML?

  <p>

    <ul>

      <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly,
	  then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend

	  <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important
	    for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong <em>strong emphasised?</strong>
	    what is this?</em>


	  <a>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's
	    look at an example: </a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">link to Mozillahomepage</a>
		
	  <li>And in order to win some time, next time you can use this kind of tools https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri+with_options</li>

    </ul>
